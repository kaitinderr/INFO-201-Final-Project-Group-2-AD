## INFO-201-Final-Project-Group-2-AD
This repository holds our final report, complete dataset, and data documentation. In this report, we set out to analyze the financial data of companies known to have government contracts with the Department of Defense in addition to the financial data of the S&P 500 market index. We compared this information to recorded battle-related deaths in conflicts involving the United States, acting as a measure of war severity. Our goal with this project was to connect trends in the stock market and find the correlation between the number of battle-related deaths and a company's growth rate in the New York Stock Exchange. The figure provided shows this relationship.

As you can see, there does not appear to be a noticeable relationship between battle-related deaths and the growth rate of a stock. This is likely due to many other factors besides battle deaths impacting a war's severity, some of which are not even quantifiable. Regarding our target audience, we find it important for those living in the US, especially young adults, to understand the impact of war on the economy in the case that a threat presents itself in the future. Additionally, we wanted to show how US corporations can benefit at the expense of the stability of other nations, as well as how corrupt politicians may utilize war to boost their stock portfolios.
